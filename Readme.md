# LLM Code Deployment Platform

## Overview

The LLM Code Deployment Platform is a robust, production-ready FastAPI application designed to automate the process of building, deploying, updating, and evaluating web applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) and GitHub Pages. This project is tailored for educational and competitive settings, where students receive coding tasks, generate solutions with LLMs, and deploy them for automated evaluation.

This platform streamlines the workflow for both students and instructors:
- **Students** receive a task brief, use an LLM to generate a web app, deploy it to GitHub Pages, and notify an evaluation server.
- **Instructors** can automate evaluation, request revisions, and track progress through a structured API and logging system.

---

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Accepts JSON POST requests for new tasks and revisions.
- **Secret Verification**: Ensures only authorized requests are processed.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses Gemini API to generate HTML, README, and LICENSE files based on task briefs and attachments.
- **Attachment Handling**: Supports image and file attachments via data URIs or URLs, saving them locally and referencing them in generated code.
- **Automated GitHub Deployment**: Creates public repositories, commits generated files, and enables GitHub Pages with retry logic.
- **Evaluation Notification**: Notifies a remote evaluation server with deployment details.
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent background tasks for stability.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs all actions to both file and console for transparency and debugging.
- **Health & Status Endpoints**: Provides `/status`, `/health`, and `/logs` endpoints for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures all background tasks are completed or safely cancelled on shutdown.

---

## Architecture

The platform is built with modern Python best practices:
- **FastAPI** for high-performance async API handling
- **Pydantic & pydantic-settings** for robust data validation and environment management
- **httpx** for async HTTP requests (LLM, GitHub, evaluation server)
- **GitPython** for local repository management
- **Asyncio** for background task orchestration
- **Structured Logging** for observability

### Main Components
- **main.py**: Core application logic, API endpoints, background task management
- **.env**: Environment variable configuration (API keys, secrets, tokens)
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies
- **Dockerfile** (optional): For containerized deployment

---

## API Usage

### 1. Submitting a Task (Round 1)

**Endpoint:** `POST /ready`

**Request Body Example:**
```json
{
  "email": "student@example.com",
  "secret": "<your-student-secret>",
  "task": "captcha-solver-123",
  "round": 1,
  "nonce": "ab12-cdef-3456",
  "brief": "Create a captcha solver that handles ?url=https://.../image.png. Default to attached sample.",
  "evaluation_url": "https://example.com/notify",
  "attachments": [
    { "name": "sample.png", "url": "data:image/png;base64,..." }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "message": "Task captcha-solver-123 received and processing started."
}
```

### 2. Submitting a Revision (Round 2+)

Send a similar POST request with `"round": 2` and an updated brief or attachments. The system will perform a minimal, safe update to the deployed app.

### 3. Status & Logs
- `GET /status`: Shows last received task and running background tasks
- `GET /health`: Service heartbeat
- `GET /logs`: Recent log output (configurable lines)

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Configure `.env` file**
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
   STUDENT_SECRET=your_student_secret
   ```
5. **Run the server**
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

---

## Deployment Instructions

- The app can be run locally or deployed via Docker for production use.
- Ensure your GitHub token has `repo` and `pages` permissions.
- The server will create a `generated_tasks/` directory for local file storage.
- All logs are written to `logs/app.log` by default.

---

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** or any secrets to version control.
- All secrets and tokens are loaded from environment variables.
- The API will reject any request with an invalid secret.
- GitHub tokens are used only for repo creation and deployment, never stored in code or logs.
- Attachments are validated and only image files are processed for LLM input.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check that your secret in the POST request matches `STUDENT_SECRET` in `.env`.
- **422 Unprocessable Content**: Ensure your JSON request matches the expected schema.
- **LLM or GitHub errors**: Check `logs/app.log` for detailed error messages.
- **GitHub Pages not updating**: The system retries enabling Pages, but manual intervention may be needed if GitHub is slow.
- **Environment variables not loading**: Ensure `.env` is in the working directory and not overridden by system environment variables.
